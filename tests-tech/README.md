fastory.io

Built a website with a front and backend using SWAPI a star wars Api


On my front-end:
You can search for people, vehicles, starships, and planets through a 
searchbar and specify the type of data you are searching by selecting.
By searching you get back the Basic information for each.


On the Back-end:
Created async querries allowing to receive input from my front and
send back the information from the api database to the frontend
